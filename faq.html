<summary>What is a tennis bracelet?</summary>
<p>A tennis bracelet is a delicate bracelet featuring a continuous line of diamonds or gemstones set in precious metal, typically gold or platinum. The design consists of individually set stones linked together in a flexible line that wraps around the wrist. It got its name from a famous incident during the 1987 US Open when professional tennis player Chris Evert's diamond bracelet broke mid-match, causing her to stop play until it was found. Before this event, these bracelets were called 'eternity bracelets' or 'inline diamond bracelets,' but the publicity from Evert's incident permanently changed the terminology. The design emphasizes symmetry and continuous sparkle, with each stone receiving individual attention in the setting process. Modern tennis bracelets range from simple single-row designs to elaborate multi-row and mixed-stone variations, but all share the characteristic flexible, continuous line of gemstones that made the original style iconic.</p>

<details>
<summary>How much does a tennis bracelet cost?</summary>
<p>Tennis bracelet prices range from $500 to $50,000 or more, depending on the quality and size of diamonds, metal type, and brand. Most quality tennis bracelets with genuine diamonds start around $1,000 to $3,000 for pieces with smaller stones (0.5-1 total carats) in 14k gold. A 2 carat diamond tennis bracelet from a reputable jeweler typically costs $3,500-$12,000, while a 3 carat version ranges from $8,000-$25,000. Luxury brands like Tiffany's command significant premiums, with comparable pieces costing 2-3 times more than independent jewelers. Colored gemstone options like ruby tennis bracelets or pink sapphire tennis bracelets can cost 20-40% less than diamond equivalents depending on stone quality and origin. Fashion alternatives using Swarovski crystals or cubic zirconia, such as the Swarovski matrix tennis bracelet, offer the aesthetic at $150-$800. The primary cost drivers are total carat weight, individual stone quality (cut, clarity, color), metal purity, brand reputation, and craftsmanship quality.

<details>
<summary>What size tennis bracelet should I buy?</summary>
<p>Tennis bracelets typically range from 6.5 to 8 inches in length, with 7 inches being the most common size that fits the majority of women. The bracelet should fit snugly but comfortably with about half an inch of movement around your wrist—tight enough to prevent excessive sliding but loose enough to move slightly when you shake your hand. To determine your ideal size, measure your wrist at its widest point with a flexible measuring tape, then add 0.5 to 1 inch depending on your fit preference. If your wrist measures 6 inches, a 6.5-inch bracelet provides a snug fit while a 7-inch offers more comfortable movement. Petite individuals with 5.5-6 inch wrists should consider 6.5-inch bracelets, while those with larger wrists measuring 7-7.5 inches need 8-inch or custom lengths. The fit becomes more critical with expensive pieces like a 3 carat diamond tennis bracelet, as too-loose bracelets increase loss risk while too-tight settings can damage the prongs and settings through constant pressure. Most jewelers offer free sizing adjustments within the first 30 days, though adding or removing links affects the stone count and overall appearance.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you clean a tennis bracelet?</summary>
<p>Clean your tennis bracelet by soaking it in warm soapy water for 10-15 minutes, then gently scrub with a soft toothbrush and rinse with clean water. Use mild dish soap without moisturizers or harsh chemicals, and ensure the water is warm rather than hot to avoid thermal shock to the stones. Pay special attention to the underside of each stone where oils and debris accumulate, as this buildup reduces sparkle significantly. After rinsing thoroughly under running water, pat dry with a lint-free cloth and allow to air dry completely before storing. For deeper cleaning, take your bracelet to a professional jeweler every 6-12 months for ultrasonic cleaning and inspection. Professional cleaning is particularly important for 14k gold tennis bracelets and pieces with valuable stones, as jewelers simultaneously check prong security and identify potential issues before they cause stone loss. Avoid harsh chemicals including chlorine, bleach, and abrasive cleaners, which can damage both metal and stones. Remove your tennis bracelet before swimming, showering, or applying lotions and perfumes, as these substances accelerate buildup and can weaken settings over time. Store your bracelet separately in a soft pouch to prevent scratching from contact with other jewelry.</p>

<details>
<summary>Are lab-grown diamond tennis bracelets worth buying?</summary>
<p>Lab-grown diamond tennis bracelets offer excellent value for buyers prioritizing size and appearance over natural origin, typically costing 50-70% less than natural diamond equivalents. These diamonds are chemically, physically, and optically identical to natural diamonds, scoring 10 on the Mohs hardness scale and displaying the same brilliance and fire. A 2 carat lab-grown diamond tennis bracelet might cost $3,000-$5,000 compared to $8,000-$12,000 for natural stones of similar quality. The primary trade-off is resale value—lab-grown diamonds typically retain only 20-30% of purchase price in secondary markets compared to 40-60% for natural diamonds. However, if you plan to keep the bracelet indefinitely rather than viewing it as an investment, lab-grown options provide substantially more visual impact per dollar spent. They're particularly appealing for fashion-forward buyers who want the look of a 3 carat diamond tennis bracelet without the corresponding investment. Certification from GIA or IGI is equally important for lab-grown stones to verify quality claims. The ethical considerations also appeal to some buyers, as lab-grown diamonds avoid the environmental and social concerns associated with mining, though the natural diamond industry has made significant progress in responsible sourcing through the <a href="https://www.kpcs.org/">Kimberley Process</a>.</p>

<summary>What's the difference between a tennis bracelet and a regular diamond bracelet?</summary>
<p>A tennis bracelet specifically features a symmetrical line of individually set diamonds or gemstones of uniform size and quality, creating a continuous flexible band, while regular diamond bracelets encompass any bracelet design incorporating diamonds without this specific structure. Tennis bracelets emphasize consistency—each stone matches in size, cut, and quality to create seamless sparkle around the entire wrist. In contrast, regular diamond bracelets might feature clustered stones, asymmetric designs, mixed stone sizes, or diamonds as accent elements rather than the primary focus. The setting style also differs: tennis bracelets use individual settings for each stone (prong, bezel, or channel), while other diamond bracelets might incorporate pave settings, clusters, or diamonds set into solid metal designs. The flexibility is another distinguishing factor—tennis bracelets articulate between each stone or small groups of stones, creating fluid movement, whereas other diamond bracelets might be rigid bangles or have limited flexibility. The name itself carries specific expectations: calling something a 'ruby and diamond tennis bracelet' indicates alternating stones in tennis bracelet style, while a 'ruby and diamond bracelet' could be any design incorporating both stones. Tennis bracelets are also typically more delicate and refined, making them suitable for formal occasions and stacking with other bracelets, while regular diamond bracelets range from delicate to bold statement pieces.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I tell if a tennis bracelet has real diamonds?</summary>
<p>Verifying real diamonds in a tennis bracelet requires examining certification, conducting physical tests, and professional assessment. Legitimate tennis bracelet real diamond pieces should include certification from recognized gemological laboratories like <a href="https://www.gia.edu/">GIA</a>, AGS, or IGI that document each stone's characteristics. Request this documentation before purchase and verify the certificate number on the laboratory's website to confirm authenticity. Physical indicators include the fog test—breathe on a diamond and it should clear immediately, while simulants stay foggy for 2-4 seconds due to different thermal conductivity. Real diamonds also show imperfections under 10x magnification; perfectly flawless stones at moderate prices are likely simulants. Check the metal stamp inside the clasp: genuine pieces typically use 14k, 18k, or platinum rather than lower-quality metals. The weight test helps too—real diamonds are denser than cubic zirconia, so a natural diamond tennis bracelet feels heavier than a CZ version of identical size. However, the most reliable verification comes from an independent jeweler's appraisal using a diamond tester, which measures thermal or electrical conductivity to distinguish real diamonds from simulants. Be particularly cautious with online purchases lacking certification, prices that seem too good to be true (a '3 carat diamond tennis bracelet' for under $2,000 is almost certainly fake), and sellers who refuse independent appraisal. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-jewelry-guides">Federal Trade Commission</a> requires accurate disclosure of diamond treatments, lab-grown stones, and simulants, so sellers must clearly state if stones aren't natural diamonds.</p>

<summary>Can you wear a tennis bracelet every day?</summary>
<p>You can wear a tennis bracelet every day, though this requires choosing an appropriate design and following careful maintenance practices to prevent damage and loss. A 1 carat diamond tennis bracelet in 14k gold with secure prong or bezel settings works well for daily wear, offering durability without excessive exposure risk. Choose pieces with safety clasps featuring double-locking mechanisms, as the repetitive motion and potential impacts of daily activities increase loss risk with standard clasps alone. Remove your bracelet before activities that might damage it: exercising, swimming, cleaning with chemicals, gardening, or any work involving your hands. Daily wear accelerates prong wear, so have a jeweler inspect the settings every 6 months rather than annually to catch problems before stones loosen. Many tennis bracelet owners adopt a two-bracelet strategy: a more modest 1-2 carat piece for daily wear and a showpiece 3 carat diamond tennis bracelet reserved for special occasions. This approach provides the enjoyment of wearing tennis bracelets regularly while protecting significant investments from unnecessary risk. Consider your lifestyle realistically—if you're very active or work with your hands extensively, even a durable design faces higher damage risk than occasional wear. Insurance is essential for daily-wear pieces valued above $2,000, as the increased exposure elevates both loss and damage probability.
